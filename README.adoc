Atlassian have open-sourced some [general purpose concurrency utilities](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-util-concurrent), including a copy-on-write map.

In comment on [an answer on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4298847/116639), an Atlassian developer states:

> In our testing, our CopyOnWriteMap (with an underlying j.u.HashMap) outperformed ConcurrentHashMap for reads.

This project is a quick attempt to benchmark that proposition.

To run the benchmarks, do:

....
./gradlew --no-daemon clean jmh
....

The first run will take a while because it will download the universe. After that should be reasonably quick.

Disable the daemon because it caches some wrong stuff and breaks if you change the benchmark code.

One run of the benchmarks gave results like this:

|===
| Benchmark                 |  Score (ns/op) | Error (ns/op)
| nothing                   |          5.496 |         0.149
| getHashMap                |         13.641 |         0.951
| getConcurrentHashMap      |         14.245 |         0.650
| getCopyOnWriteMap         |         13.622 |         0.745
| getSynchronizedHashMap    |       1830.361 |        63.931
| putHashMap                |         76.278 |         7.015
| putConcurrentHashMap      |        283.118 |        32.452
| putCopyOnWriteMap         |  122228945.640 |  59571496.604
| putSynchronizedHashMap    |       3261.789 |       113.856
| mixedHashMap              |         17.421 |         0.660
| mixedConcurrentHashMap    |         29.815 |         0.958
| mixedCopyOnWriteMap       |     185171.134 |    138735.833
| mixedSynchronizedHashMap  |       1911.981 |        84.563
|===

This suggests that for reads, ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteMap are about the same speed, and not significantly slower than a plain HashMap, whilst much faster than a synchronized HashMap. For writes, of course, the CopyOnWriteMap is substantially slower.
